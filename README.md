## Idea of the project

There are many financial accounting applications, but the main **disadvantage** of these applications is that they require **significant effort** to enter data into the application.

The idea of this project is to create an application that will not only take into account income and expenses of funds, but also provide the ability to plan and create schedules based on statistical data.

The main objective of this project is to make it **as simple as possible**.

For example, you pay a fixed amount for utilities every month, the application will **remind** you of this.
Or let's imagine you use public transport every day, after a while the application will **offer** to create a schedule to reflect the costs, it was possible just by clicking a button.
Another use case is when spending money in a category is regular but with different amounts, for example, every Saturday you shop for groceries for a week, the application will **force** you complete the payment.
